                <p><strong>Project highlights: </strong>This is a simplified message queue component in C++ modeled
                    after RabbitMQ, focusing on efficiently handling the publish-subscribe mechanism. This project not
                    only reproduces the core architecture of RabbitMQ, but also optimizes the message transmission
                    process in a targeted manner, supporting cross-host message publishing, subscription and push
                    functions. During the implementation process, I used the muduo network library to build a stable
                    server-client communication framework, and designed the application layer protocol through protobuf
                    to ensure the efficiency and accuracy of data transmission. In addition, the project also integrates
                    the sqlite database for data persistence management, ensuring the reliability of the message system
                    and the security of the data. Through this project, I have a deep understanding and practice of the
                    high-performance implementation technology of the message queue, ensuring the high availability and
                    scalability of the system.

                <p><strong>Project highlights: </strong>This project is a search engine implementation based on the
                    Boost library, aiming to provide an efficient and accurate search system specifically for searching
                    Boost documents. By elaborating on the search engine building process, from data preprocessing to
                    index creation, to search query processing and result presentation, this project shows how to build
                    a complete search engine system. The technology stack covers C++, Boost library, Html, CSS and
                    JavaScript, realizing back-end index construction and front-end user interaction. The basic
                    functions of the project are comprehensive, and advanced features such as word frequency statistics,
                    dynamically updated indexes, and search result priority sorting have been added, which significantly
                    improves search efficiency and accuracy. This makes the search engine particularly suitable for
                    developers to quickly find the technical documents they need when using Boost libraries, greatly
                    improving development efficiency and document accessibility.

                    I implemented the core functions in tcmalloc through learning and simulation, and implemented a

                    purpose is to adapt to the characteristics of a single server with multiple CPU cores, and to ensure
                    that the performance of the memory allocator will not drop sharply due to multi-core competition. In
                    order to reduce memory usage, objects of the same memory size are concentrated in spans composed of
                    several adjacent pages.

                <p><strong>Project highlights: </strong>This project implements an efficient communication framework
                    between the client and the server through epoll, which is designed for high-performance I/O
                    operations. The architecture includes a client and a server. The client starts multiple worker
                    threads and generates data following a negative
                    exponential distribution according to the specified lambda parameter. These data are sent through
                    their respective pipes to the epoll service monitored by the poll_control class, ensuring the
                    efficiency of lock-free operations. The epoll service
                    handles read and write events, caches the data and sends it to the server, which is the same as the
                    client's data flow. Each data block is attached with a process and thread identifier to enhance
                    traceability.<br>

                <p><strong>Project highlights: </strong>This project implements a pipeline communication system
                    framework
                    based on dual thread pools from scratch, which is essentially communication between processes. <br>
                    The thread pool object code of this project is highly maintainable and highly readable. Thread pool
                    objects can be easily reused in other projects <br>

                <p><strong>Project highlights:</strong></p>
                <li>We propose an effective facial video-based end-to-end PD severity diagnosis deep learning model,
                    which can extract features from PD patient videos and give robust and interpretable diagnosis
                    results.</li>
                <li>We effectively integrate channel and spatial attention mechanisms into a 3D neural network
                    model, which ensures that the model can learn non-redundant features. In addition, the effective
                    embedding of LSTM and ResNet further strengthens the robustness of the model.</li>
                <li>We effectively judge the severity of PD disease through various facial expressions of PD. In
                    addition, we also designed a series of interpretability experiments to provide further
                    explanations for our video analysis model, which is of great significance for assisting doctors
                    in diagnosis.</li>
                <li>Our experimental results show that our lightweight model achieves competitive performance while
                    other deep learning models have suboptimal performance. We also performed a correlation analysis
                    between our diagnostic results and clinical data, and experimental results further confirmed the
                    reliability of our results.</li>
